## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix:
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object that 
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
	i <- NULL
	set <- function(matrix){
		x <<- matrix
		i <<- NULL
	}
	get <- function() x
	setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
	getinverse <- function() i
	list(set = set, get = get, setinverse = setinverse, getinverse = getinverse)
}


## Write a short comment describing this function

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" created by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
## matrix has not changed), then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    i <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(i)){
    	message('getting cached data')
    	return(i)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    i <- solve(data)
    x$setinverse(i)
    i
}
